        <h4>The Midterm</h4>
        <p>
            The midterm is an open-ended project. Given the emphasis on conceptual/contextual foundations emphasized in the beginning of this course, there is no expectation for a "material-based" blockchain project for the midterm (or, technically, for the final, but we'll come back to that later). Specifically, the work doesn't have to exist on a blockchain platform like the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains. Plenty of artists working with blockchain create works that simulate or point to a blockchain without actually using it.
            <br><br>
            Blockchain as a technology provides a number of entry points for creative exploration and inquiry, and doesn't prescribe any "correct" path for creation. <em>Your artistic approach to the blockchain contributes to the definition of what it is/what it can do</em>. As artists working technology, we often aren't just experimenting aesthetically with a tool; we're actively using our medium of choice to interrogate how a technology operates in the systems we inhabit. Sometimes that means creating work that pokes holes in a technology until it crumbles, other times it means speculating about ways the technology might be used for good. And of course other times, the work doesn't fall neatly into either of those categories.
            <br><br>
            For the midterm, you will be expected to present a work that conceptually engages blockchain technology and/or the culture surrounding it. While these midterm projects will largely be conceptual art projects, they should include some "material" artifacts (I use the word 'material' here loosely...).
            <br><br>
            Your work can take on a number of forms. For example:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A website</li>
                <li>A mock website</li>
                <li>A Powerpoint Performance</li>
                <li>A performance</li>
                <li>A video</li>
                <li>A photograph</li>
                <li>A series of photographs</li>
                <li>A drawing</li>
                <li>A social experiment</li>
                <li>A group activity
                <li>A walking tour</li>
                <li>A website combined with a custom cryptocurrency and a Powerpoint performance</li>
                <li>A game manual</li>
                <li>A contract</li>
                <li>A poem</li>
                <li>A short story</li>
                <li>A long story</li>
                <li>A whitepaper</li>
                <li>A song</li>
                <li>pretty much anything</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Your project can extend the proof-of-X/token exercise we've done in class. It can also function as a pseudo-proposal, or some foundation-laying for your final project. But whatever form it takes, I want to emphasize that we are presenting them as <strong><em>art works</em></strong>, and they'll be critiqued as such!
            <br><br>

            <strong>Critique format:</strong> 20-minutes per critique. Time will be divided up for the artist to present their work, the audience to give feedback, and the artist to respond to the feedback.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Midterm Critiques:</strong> Week 7 (October 15, 2019)
