##### _Create your own cipher workshop:_
Form a group, and come up with your own method/algorithm for translating text into a cipher. Then, see if other groups can decrypt your cipher.

Group submissions:
1. yall will never get this (reverse alphabet)
2. this is blockchain (ROT3 + square root function)
3. what did you eat for lunch? (numerical substitution)
4. HOW ARE YOU? (color substitution (unique to each letter))

##### _PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) Workshop_
_Public key/private key encryption_
(coming soon!) Here's a link to the web page we were working from: <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/pgp-and-you" traget="blank">PGP and You</a>, but I'm going to–in this section–write up the specific steps/commands we did for this workshop.

### Assignment

##### Readings
1. <a href="http://torquetorque.net/wp-content/uploads/ArtistsReThinkingTheBlockchain.pdf" target="blank">_Artists Re:Thinking the Blockchain_</a> p. 9-37 (A Quasi Proto Preface, Introduction)
2. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17091766/blockchain-bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-meaning" target="blank">_'Blockchain' is Meaningless_</a> – The Verge

##### Assignments
1. __Read the above readings__
1. __3 Questions based on the reading:__ Write down ANY 3 questions you have from the readings. We'll answer them in class on 09/10!
1. __3 words you want to know more about:__ Similar to the questions, write down 5 words you come across that confuse or intrigue you. I encourage you to Google your five words to know more, but it'd be great to also look at your words in class, and see what other people are interested in
1. __A blockchain is...:__ In your own words, write a 1-2 sentence summary of a blockchain. If your answer is still "idk" that's fine :). We'll do this assignment a few times over the semester as our knowledge grows. Feel free to be poetic.

##### Bonus
We kind of just launched right into the command line last Tuesday, and I think that went pretty well for most of you! But if you want to learn more about what the Terminal is/some basic commands for navigating it, I encourage you to complete __Chapters 1 and 2__ of this tutorial:
