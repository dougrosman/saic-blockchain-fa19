    > "For the artist, these works were the inverse of the operation by which Marcel Duchamp had created the ready-made nearly six decades before: instead of removing an object from the commercial field and placing it in the consecrated field of art, Cildo Meireles proposed the insertion of noisy information in the homogenous field in which merchandise circulates and is exchanged. He moreover questioned the notion of the authorship of the artwork, since he encouraged others to make their insertions of their own, by way of the procedural instructions he furnished."
