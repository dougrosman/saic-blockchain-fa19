## Proof-of-X Assignment

The Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm, combined with the immutable, distributed, decentralized ledger that is Blockchain was the revolutionary breakthrough that set the stage for a stateless, bankless digital currency in the form of Bitcoin. But Proof-of-Work—a process that expends enormous amounts of energy around the globe–is an incredibly wasteful technology.

What alternatives might there be to create a valuable currency through practices that challenge or subvert the model presented by Proof-of-Work?

__For this assignment, come up with your own Proof-of-X process. Craft a story around it through text/video/image/a website/a poem/a short story/a walking tour/a show and tell of items that are important to you.__

Here are some questions/ideas that may guide you towards conjuring a proof-of-X system.

* Utilizing a bodily process (proof-of- breathing, proof-of-sweat, etc.)
* It can be random! Like, Proof-of-Pigeons, a process where a certain patch of sidewalk will generate tokens if enough pigeons occupy that space. How might human behavior shift in this space to generate value? Will people start feeding pigeons more?
* Who might benefit from your system? Everyone? No one?
* What socioeconomic factors intersect with your system?
* You can make totally unrealistic systems, or ground them in reality. Whatever you choose to do, think about how society would shift around this process if everyone took it seriously.
* Could your Proof-of-X system reflect a practice of your local community? Cryptocurrencies can be a local phenomenon...
