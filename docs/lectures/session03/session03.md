    > "For the artist, these works were the inverse of the operation by which Marcel Duchamp had created the ready-made nearly six decades before: instead of removing an object from the commercial field and placing it in the consecrated field of art, Cildo Meireles proposed the insertion of noisy information in the homogenous field in which merchandise circulates and is exchanged. He moreover questioned the notion of the authorship of the artwork, since he encouraged others to make their insertions of their own, by way of the procedural instructions he furnished."

The phrase "late to the party" describes well how I often feel when doing research on how to interact with the blockchain. The party started at 9am (2013), some people show up, but it's not a banger. People trickle in and then all of a sudden it feels like a party by like 11:30. That's late 2017/early 2018. The party peaks for around an hour. People who were there doing the peak generally feel pretty good, and may ride the wave for the rest of the party. But then some people, those who show up at 1am, are sorely disappointed. They heard a party was going down, and the were right. They just missed the best part. People arrive and get an impression that "something" went down but you'll never quite know. You can ask people about it and they'll tell you, but you'll never really know, cuz you weren't there.
Have you ever shown up at a party, or some sort of event
