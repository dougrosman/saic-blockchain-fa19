#### EMAIL POLICY
Whether you're a student or faculty, we are all inundated with emails. Sometimes they slip by me. If I don't respond to your email within 24 hours (or 12 if it's urgent), don't hesitate to give me a nudge. Just passive-aggressively reply to the original email you sent me with something along the lines of "psst. hey." I won't be offended or think you're needy :). That said, I'll only respond to emails between 8am-8pm. Boundaries are important!
<br>

Don't hesitate to reach out!

### COURSE DESCRIPTION
**_Blockchain: The New Internet_** will explore blockchain technology as a material for artistic practice and deep critical engagement. Blockchain—a technology designed for the secure storage and transmission of data on a decentralized network—is still in its relative infancy, yet its integration into the social fabric has had far-reaching transformations. What began as a system for facilitating digital payments, like Bitcoin, could potentially revolutionize the internet as we know it.

Students in this course will learn about current applications of blockchain as well as the fundamental technical skills to utilize blockchain technology such as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and the Solidity programming language, and will apply these tools toward crafting blockchain-based art works. We will examine the works of contemporary artists working with and around blockchain technologies today like Sarah Meyoas, Simon Denny, Rob Meyers and Larva Labs, while also exploring the work of conceptual artists that explore the relationship between art, networks and economic value like Piero Manzoni, Justin Gignac and Hans Haacke. Readings will cover aspects of the new Internet, the evolution of money, and forms of social exchange. Additional screenings and readings will provide technical foundation for blockchain technology. Students will create a mid-term and final project with respective critiques. Weekly homework assignments will incorporate technical exercises to reinforce in-class material and brief written responses to assigned readings.

### COURSE MATERIALS
* A computer that can connect to the internet. The class will be held in a computer lab, so there will be access to computers if you do not have your own.
* $5. While we can engage with blockchains like the Ethereum blockchain on __free test networks__, there may be situations where you need to have an Etheruem wallet with a minimum amount of funds in place. In general, all transactions on the main Ethereum blockchain (as well almost all cryptocurrencies) require a small fee.

### ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES:
SAIC is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal opportunities for students with disabilities. Students with known or suspected disabilities, such as a Reading/Writing Disorder, ADD/ADHD, and/or a mental health condition who think they would benefit from assistance or accommodations should first contact the Disability and Learning Resource Center (DLRC) to schedule an appointment. DLRC staff will review your disability documentation and work with you to determine reasonable accommodations. They will then provide you with a letter outlining the approved accommodations for you to deliver to your instructors. This letter must be presented before any accommodations will be implemented. You should contact the DLRC as early in the semester as possible. The DLRC is located within the Wellness Center on the 13th floor of 116 S Michigan Ave. and can be reached via phone at 312.499.4278 or email at dlrc@saic.edu.

### ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT:
From the SAIC Student Handbook:
“Academic misconduct includes both plagiarism and cheating, and may consist of: the submission of the work of another as one’s own; unauthorized assistance on a test or assignment; submission of the same work for more than one class without the knowledge and consent of all instructors; or the failure to properly cite texts or ideas from other sources. Academic misconduct also includes the falsification of academic or student-related records, such as transcripts, evaluations and letters of recommendation. Academic misconduct extends to all spaces on campus, including satellite locations and online education.
Academic integrity is expected in all coursework, including online learning. It is assumed that the person receiving the credit for the course is the person completing the work. SAIC has processes in place, including LDAP authentication, to verify student identity.”
Additional resources for students:
* Read “Plagiarism: How to Recognize It and Avoid It: a short guide prepared by the Faculty Senate Student Life Subcommittee in 2004.
* Read the Flaxman Library’s quick guide titled “When to give credit.”

### ATTENDANCE
SAIC policy states that students are expected to attend all classes regularly and on time. Students should miss class only with reasonable cause. If a student needs to miss class with reasonable cause, it is the student’s responsibility to contact the instructor to receive instruction for how to make up for the missed class. It is the instructor’s responsibility to give this information to the student as his/her/their schedule permits. Missing class for other than a reasonable cause may jeopardize the student’s academic standing in the class. Attendance is required on the two final critique days to receive credit for this course.
<br>

__If a student misses MORE than three classes, whether or not for a reasonable cause, the student will fail the class__, if the student does not withdraw from the class prior to the deadline for withdrawal with a grade  of "W."
__Three late arrivals will count as an absence.__
__Arriving more than 45 minutes late to class will count as an absence__

__Deadline for withdrawal:__ Fall 2019 semester: Tuesday, October 29, 2019
##### Reasonable cause to miss a class might include:
* Illness or hospitalization (the student should also contact Health Services or their academic advisor, who will relay information to
the faculty in whose class the student is enrolled)
* Family illness or death (the student should also contact their academic advisor, who can relay information to all faculty)
* Observation of a religious holiday (students are expected to notify their instructors in advance to discuss reasonable
accommodations for holidays they might observe). <br>

Show your faculty/classmates respect by coming to class on time every day.

### DIVERSITY STATEMENT:
It is incredibly important that this class maintains a respectful, safe and inclusive environment. All students–regardless of their gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background–should feel the comfort we all deserve in order to thrive academically, artistically, and to thrive in general.
<br>

Additionally, in regard to different technical backgrounds and learning to code: everyone in this class brings a variety of artistic and technical skills to the table. That said, almost nobody learns how to code the same way, or at the same rate. It's safe to say that, generally, we all learn differently. So if you've never coded before, this class is a great place to start. If you find you're feeling discouraged, just remember that with each new error you encounter, you're becoming a better coder (although inevitably you'll encounter the same ones over and over again).
<br>

So please, don't hesitate to ask questions, or ask me to slow down, or to repeat something! I'm here to help!
